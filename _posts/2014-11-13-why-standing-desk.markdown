Today's blog post isn't about coding per-se, but instead about life as a coder,
and how switching to a standing desk could be a big win. I'll cover why I made
the switch, how I did it, things I learned along the way. At the end I'll tell
you how this all culminated in me designing and building my own standing desk,
which is something I highly recommend (if you're brave enough to try!).

This is a long post, so here's the **tldr**: sitting is bad for you, standing
is great, and building your own desk is very hard work but worth it in the end.

## Why Stand?

If you haven’t heard, sitting all day is not good for you. If you want to hear
all about it, I encourage you to check out the
[article about standing desks at the Wirecutter][1]. The money quote: 

> “It doesn’t matter if you go running every morning, or you’re a regular at
  the gym. If you spend most of the rest of the day sitting — in your car, your
  office chair, on your sofa at home — you are putting yourself at increased
  risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, a variety of cancers and an early
  death. In other words, irrespective of whether you exercise vigorously,
  sitting for long periods is bad for you.”

Like most devs, I used to sit at the computer all day. But after a few years
of steadily increasing back pain, I decided I’d had enough, and I started
finding ways to stand. I’ve been doing it nearly full-time now for two years,
and don’t intend to go back. In this article I’ll outline for you how I waded
my way into the standing desk world, and eventually took the ultimate plunge
and built my own standing desk.

## Phase 1: Trial Runs

The first thing you’ll find when you start looking for a standing desk setup is
that this is not as simple as running to Ikea or Staples and picking up a new
piece of furniture. While standing at work is more “normal” now than it was a
few years ago, this is still not “mainstream,” therefore most commercial
manufactured standing desks are not cheap, $1000 + is typical as of this
writing.

When I started thinking about standing I was not prepared to shell out over a
thousand bucks to try this idea out. Instead, I followed the standing desk
tradition of hacking together a standing desk. For me this meant setting a
cardboard box on top of my desk, which became the keyboard and mouse support,
and putting my iMac up on a shelf so the display would be at the right height
for standing.

When I first switched to a laptop with an external monitor, I also found that
a chair on top of a desk or table is often the right height for your monitor,
then any kind of box will do for your keyboard / mouse surface. Creating a
quick hack like this is one of the best ways to test this idea without spending
too much money or time.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Experiment 1" alt="Experiment 1" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-test-1.jpg">

This difference between standing and sitting monitor height is one of the
trickiest things about a standing desk setup - your monitor’s normal stand is
almost certainly not going to be adjustable up to the height you need when you
shift from seated to standing. If you don’t happen to have a shelf that’s just
about right for you, you might try stacking books or boxes to give the monitor
a boost instead.

If you’re working from home, pretty much anything that gets your keyboard to
elbow height and monitor to “face” height will suffice. If you work in an
office, they may not be ok with the aesthetics of a hack-desk. In this case I
would recommend trying  a standing setup at home for a while first, and plead
the case with your office manager once you’re comfortable and committed to
standing.

## Ergonomic Requirements Gathering

There are two key ergonomic considerations for standing desk: surface height
(where your hands go), and monitor height (where your eyes go).

In my experience, I found surface height to be *much* more important than
monitor height. Surface height is also harder to adjust. Most sources I read
recommend the surface be just below the height of your elbow. Make sure you’re
standing up straight when you measure - you might be losing an inch or more to
slouching and not even realize it.

Measuring is a good start, but the only real way to know the right surface
height is to put together books and boxes and whatever other flat surfaces you
can find and try standing and typing at different heights. You’ll probably find
there’s a range of ~2” or so within which you’re quite comfortable. If in doubt,
I would set your work surface to be on the high end of your comfort range.
I find this makes me more conscious of standing up straight and helps me avoid
slouching.

As for monitor height, generally you don’t want to be looking “up” at the
screen. You’ll tend to be a bit closer to the screen when standing then you were
when you were sitting, and you may notice (as I did) that when standing you
become more aware of the size of your monitor and how much you have to turn
your head to see things in the corners of it. Standing makes me more aware of
how much I have to turn my head to focus on the sides or corners of my monitor,
and how much it can strain my neck to do this for extended periods of time.
I’ve had a lot less neck pain since I switched to standing, so I think that this
is a win.

Between these two factors, in my experience the height and angle of the monitor
are much less important than the desk surface height. Close your eyes, stand up
straight, rest your hands on the keyboard in typing position, and then open your
eyes and note where the center of your field of vision is. Put the center of
your monitor there, about arms length away, and you should feel pretty good.

## Getting comfortable

If you’ve never stood for long periods of time before, you’re going to
experience some new sensations when you start. Your feet and knees might get
tired. You may be surprised to find your quads or core muscles are a bit sore
like they would be after a good workout in the gym. You may find you are
hungrier than you were before.

This is pretty much the whole idea: your body expends more effort when you
stand. What you should not experience is back and neck pain. There’s a real
difference between muscle fatigue that comes from healthy exertion and muscle
or joint pain that comes from unhealthy strain. If you’ve experienced both then
I’m sure you’ll feel like I did: exertion fatigue is infinitely better than
joint or muscle strain.

Most of this will go away in a couple weeks. You should find that when you
stand you are not standing perfectly still, but are sort of shifting from
side to side or even pacing just a bit. The more you move around while standing,
the less stiffness or fatigue you should feel at the end of the day.

The best way to make sure you have success in the transition to standing is to
get a good stool or drafting chair that you can use as part of your setup. Lean
against the stool or take a break and sit in the chair some. This gives your
legs a little break, and you’ll find you naturally shift and alternate between
standing and leaning frequently, which is just more good movement and activity.

The worst thing I’ve experienced since I switched to standing desk is shin
splints. This first happened to me when I moved and my office setup was on
hardwood floors and not carpet. After 4-6 weeks in my new setup I started
getting shin splints. I started wearing good shoes when I stand all day, and
this mostly went away. Occasionally I get a little shin pain and after that I
usually just take my laptop to a comfortable chair and sit for half a day or
so, that little bit of rest is enough to get me “back on my feet.”

## Phase 3: Cardboard-free solution

After working with my keyboard and mouse on top of a cardboard box for a while,
I was looking for a way to improve my desk setup. Again, the key is just to find
something that’s the right height for your hands. I noticed one day that one of
our old dressers happened to be just about perfect for me, and repurposed it as
my second standing desk.

In this case the dresser was an [Ikea Hemnes 3-drawer][2], upon which I added a
couple books and a desktop pad to add about half an inch for the keyboard
height. I used a little step-stool as a monitor stand, upon which my 27” Cinema
Display and MacBook Pro fit quite nicely.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Improvized Desk" alt="Improvized Desk" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-test-2.jpg">

This setup served me well for about a year. As you can imagine, the big
drawers in the dresser are an easy place to keep all your gear, and the monitor
and keyboard sitting out on top of a dresser doesn’t really look that odd - as
improvised standing desks go.

I was relatively happy with this solution, but the biggest drawback of it is
your knees will bump up against the drawers when you take a sit-break on your
stool, and that means you’ll hunch forward more than you really should.

So, I knew that I wanted to get a better, permanent solution. Looking at all the
available options, though, I had a really hard time finding something that I
thought looked nice and seemed reasonably priced. I *loved* the
[Tinkering Monkey Standing Desk][3], but I’m not in the Bay Area so that wasn’t
going to be an option. So, in the tradition of hackers everywhere, I set out to
make my own.

## Phase 4: Design

Since I’d been standing for almost two years when I started this process, I had
a very good idea of what dimensions would be right for me. I wanted a 40”
surface height, and needed to raise the monitor base another 8” or so.

I went through a bunch of design iterations, originally intending to create
something with a built-in monitor platform and some clever fold-out leaf that
would extend the work surface. I modeled this in [SketchUp][7], which is a
fantastic 3D-drafting tool for this sort of thing.

<img class="centered" title="First round of designs" alt="First round of designs" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-designs-1.png">
<img class="centered" title="Second round of designs" alt="Second round of designs" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-designs-2.png">

After consulting with some professional wood-workers about the feasibility of
these designs, I reconsidered. First, building in a monitor platform means it
may not be the right height if I get a different monitor in the future. Second,
doing some complex fold-out surface is significantly more complicated than a
flat surface, and as this was my first major woodworking project just doing a
“simple” desk was going to be complex enough.

I went back to the drawing board and simplified the concept quite a bit.

<img class="centered" title="Third round of designs" alt="Third round of designs" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-designs-3.png">

In hindsight, this was the best decision I made. The final design looked like
this:

<img class="centered" title="Final Design" alt="Final Design" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-design-final.png">

I originally planned for a 24x44” work surface. When I actually got in the shop
and started cutting, I decided to go with a 25x48” surface. There’s a lot to be
said for doing these things by feel, what you make in the shop doesn’t always
feel the way you expected when you started out in the shop.

I wanted the desk to be a solid hardwood that would look nice and age well, so I
went with American Black Walnut, which is pretty much a can’t-miss choice. You
have to be a serious idiot to make something out of Black Walnut and have it
not look nice. As merely a casual idiot (when it comes to woodworking), I liked
my chances.

## Phase 5: Construction

Walnut isn’t cheap, but I was able to buy enough rough lumber from a local
reclaim shop to get the job done (about $250 for roughly 24’ of 8/4” rough cut).

I used three major tools to do the majority of the work:

1. A joiner
2. A planer
3. A table saw (with mortise and tenon jig)

I don’t have these at home, but was able to use them at a nearby university
craft center for a small fee. Lots of colleges have these. I’ve also heard of
commercial wood and metal shops that will let you buy a studio pass to use their
gear. If you’re in a major city or college town there’s a great chance you can
find something like this near you. The other tools I used were very basic:

* Orbital Sander
* Power Drill
* Drill Press (but I could have used the power drill for all of it)
* Sandpaper
* Shop towels and sponges
* Screwdriver
* Socket wrench

I borrowed the orbital sander and I already had the drill. If you don’t own a
power drill, screwdriver, and socket wrench (or, are not willing to buy them),
this is probably not a good project for you :)

The first step was to join and plane the lumber down to dimensions I could use.
For the table top this meant individual strips roughly 1.3” x 1.5” x 44”. I
needed 14 strips total, which I glued together (short side to short side) and
then cut to length to make a “butcher block” table top.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Butcher Block Glue Up" alt="Butcher Block Glue Up" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-const-1.jpg">

The second step was to make the crossbeams and leg beams, which I cut down to
approximately 1.75” x 3”, varying lengths. This was the easiest step of the
whole process.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Legs and Crossbeams" alt="Legs and Crossbeams" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-const-2.jpg">

The hardest step was making the finger joints for the legs. I decided to make
square legs for the desk which would be finger joined together. It took a lot of
trial and error to make the finger joints. I intentionally left
about 6-8” of “extra” length on the beams for the legs, which was really
important as I screwed up at least eight times and had to chop then end off and
try again. In the end I got the pieces so they would fit pretty snugly on their
own, and then I glued them together to make the bond rock solid. Big lesson
learned here: be careful with how much glue you use at this stage. It’s not easy
to get the extra glue off the end grain of the wood when you’re done, so the
less glue you leave on the ends the better.

The finger joints came out looking very nice, but it was a ton of work.
If you want to save yourself some trouble, a simple four-leg table with the legs
butt joined into the crossbeams would have been a *lot* easier.

One of the priorities for me was that the desk be able to be disassembled and
fit into my car. I designed it so that the desk could be assembled from five
pieces: 2 legs, 2 crossbeams, and the top.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Five pieces" alt="Five pieces" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-const-3.jpg">

To join the legs and crossbeams, I installed two hangar bolts on the top of each
leg, and drilled an appropriate bolt hole on the crossbeams so that I could
attach a washer and nut on the other side, without sticking up from the beam.
This allows the table to to sit flush on top of the beam, covering the bolt
hole.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Hangar Bolts" alt="Hangar Bolts" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-const-bolts.jpg">

When the bolt is ratcheted on tight there’s very little wiggle in this desk,
despite the lack of extra cross beams, so this aspect of the design worked out
quite well.

<img class="centered bordered" title="Frame assembled" alt="Frame assembled" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-const-4.jpg">

To attach the top to the crossbeams I used six desktop fasteners  (aka “figure
eight” fasteners). These allow a little bit of horizontal expansion and
contraction. Installing these was among the trickiest details of the project:
it’s easy to put them in the cross beams but it’s hard to position the desktop
on them and be confident that you’ve really got it centered. I ended up being
slightly off-center with two of the six pilot holes I drilled for this part, but
these are small and hidden under the desk so I just drilled two new ones and the
“mistake” holes are completely hidden by the crossbeams when the desk is
assembled.

When it was all ready to assemble I finished it with Boiled Linseed Oil and
Beeswax, which is sold commercially as “[Tried and True Original Finish][4].”
I also tested samples of [General Finishes Arm-R-Seal][5] and
[Watco Danish Oil][6]. Arm-R-Seal left the wood looking closest to the original
walnut color, and the Danish Oil finish was a little lighter with more of a rose
color. I actually liked both of those slightly better color-wise, but since the
difference was slight I decided to go with the “Tried and True” finish as it’s
entirely non-toxic and food safe. I don’t plan to eat off the desk, but I can’t
help but touch the surface all the time as I’m working at it, and the other
finishes (as well as every other finish I looked at in the store) have big
warning labels indicating they are not food-safe and contain “ingredients known
to the State of California to cause cancer or birth defects.” Having read that
about something I knew I’d be touching a whole lot, and having a 6 month old
daughter in the house, I figured going with the non-toxic finish would be better
for my peace of mind.

## Final Results

<img class="centered bordered" title="Final desk" alt="Final desk" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-final-1.jpg">
<img class="centered bordered" title="Close up on the finger joints" alt="Close up on the finger joints" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-final-2.jpg">
<img class="centered bordered" title="Before and After" alt="Before and After" src="/images/posts/2014-11-13-sd-final-3.jpg">

The final result looks very nice, and has earned me a lot of compliments.
More importantly, it’s an excellent work surface that suits my standing work
style perfectly. It’s exactly the right height, because I made it that way.

All in the project cost about $350 in supplies, and $100 for the shop pass.
Considering I can continue using the shop for other projects, and many of the
supplies are re-usable (like the new drill bits I bought), I estimate the hard
cost of the project was really only about $300.

If you tried to buy a solid walnut standing height desk that was exactly the
right size for you, you’d probably be spending more than $2,000 on it,
so all-in-all I would consider this a great value on a piece of furniture that
should last a very long time, in addition to being a fun project that I can
brag about a little bit.

It took me about 3 months of Saturday afternoons to finish this.  If I hadn’t
tried to make finger joints and square legs, it would have gone about twice as
fast. I like my design, but I certainly could have made it easier for myself,
and I suspect the final result would still have looked great.

If you’ve made it all the way to the bottom of this blog post, you’re probably
considering doing something like this yourself. If so, I’d encourage you to
give it a shot! The best thing you can do to get started is to find a local
woodshop where you can use the heavy equipment, and talk to the pros there. If
you find a good shop with helpful pros, the rest is challenging but not
overwhelming. Worst-case scenario, if you try and fail you’ll still come away
with a better understanding of how furniture and other wood crafts are made,
and you’ll have a much greater appreciation for the work involved when you see
anything hand made out there in the wide world.

Cheers, and good luck!
